## Prep
Before installing Arch on my current Ubuntu Laptop, I transferred any important files from the 
Boot drive to a separate storage drive on the Laptop 

##Install
First step is to DL an ISO image of arch and use GnuPG to verify the integrity of the file using
   gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-version-x86_64.iso.sig
Using BalenaEtcher I created a bootable disk using the ISO file and a USB Drive
