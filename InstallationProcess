##Prep
Before installing Arch on my current Ubuntu Laptop, I transferred any important files from the boot drive 
to a separate storage drive on the Laptop 

##Install
First step is to download an ISO image of Arch and use the GnuPG tool to verify the integrity of the file using the command 

   gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-2025.04.01-x86_64.iso.sig

Using BalenaEtcher, I created a bootable disk using the ISO file and a USB Drive

--Issue 1 (See Troubleshooting)

After booting into the command line, I started the configuration 

   ##Verify Boot Mode (Returned correct 64-bit mode)
       /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size

   ##Connect to WiFi
      ip link (verify network interfaces)
      rfkill (check wifi card status)
      iwctl (enable wifi connectivity)
      dhcpcd (enable DHCP)
   
   ##Check System Clock
      timedatectl

   ##Partition Drive
      cfdisk
         GPT
            1GB EFI System 
               (This partition is required for booting in UEFI mode and stores the bootloader files. 
                  1GB ensures enough space for additional boot configurations or kernel updates.)
            50GB Root
               (The primary system partition where all essential files, installed packages, and configurations reside.)
            8G Swap
               (Virtual memory, beneficial for systems with limited RAM or workloads involving heavy multitasking.)
   
   ##Format & Mount Partitions

   ##Select Mirror Servers
     reflector --latest 10 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist (Selects 10 fastest mirrors based on recent sync times)

   ##Install Essential Packages
      Firmware
      Core Utilities
      Network Tools
      Grub Bootloader
      File System Utilities
      Development Tools
      CPU Microcode
      CPU Auto Frequency
      Nvidia Utils
      Timeshift System Backups

   ##System Configuration
      FSTAB
      Chroot
      Time
      Localization
      Network Config
      Root Password

##Create User & Grant Sudo Priveledges  

##Reboot System 

##Desktop Environment Setup 

I was torn between KDE and Budgie, but decided on KDE due to it being entirely new, more customizable and also presented 
more of a challenge, allowing me to learn more. 
I enjoyed the Gnome environment, and the Budgie environment seemed to expand on it, but the aesthetics are attainable in KDE.
