##Prep
Before installing Arch on my current Ubuntu Laptop, I transferred any important files from the boot drive 
to a separate storage drive on the Laptop 

##Install
First step is to download an ISO image of Arch and use the GnuPG tool to verify the integrity of the file using the command 

   'gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-2025.04.01-x86_64.iso.sig'

Using BalenaEtcher, I created a bootable disk using the ISO file and a USB Drive

--Issue 1 (See Troubleshooting)

After booting into the command line, I started the configuration 

   ##Verify Boot Mode (Returned correct 64-bit mode)
       /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size

   ##Connect to WiFi
      ip link (verify network interfaces)
      rfkill (check wifi card status)
      iwctl (enable wifi connectivity)
      dhcpcd (enable DHCP)

##Desktop Environment Setup 

I was torn between KDE and Budgie but decided on KDE due to it being entirely new and more customizable. It presented more of
a challenge and gave me more information to learn. I can also customize it to look like a Budgie environment.
